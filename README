# vurl (visited url)

## Introduction

vurl is a Python script that provides some simple filtering capabilities for URLs. The script allows the user to filter a list of URLs to show which ones have been visited, which ones have not been visited, or to remove duplicates.

The project was created in order to help organize URL visits when performing a Bug Bounty examination on the URLs. It is common (for me, at least) to get lost what URLs I have visited and the ones I haven't.
